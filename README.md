# Schoology

**PROJECT NAME:** Schoology

**THEME:** Future of Learning

**DESCRIPTION:** Hybrid education models are increasingly being adopted by educational institutions in the post-pandemic era. This approach provides students with the flexibility to attend classes both online and offline. However, it also presents unique challenges for educators who must engage with a mix of online and offline students. To address these challenges, innovative teaching methods and tools are needed. Effective solutions for monitoring, doubt sessions, intra-student communication, and grading group projects are crucial. A standardized approach to these issues would be beneficial.

We propose a web application designed to facilitate effective learning in a hybrid education environment. This application will serve as a central hub where faculty and students can meet, collaborate, share resources, and manage grading through tests, quizzes, and assignments. It aims to streamline the hybrid learning experience by integrating various essential features into one platform.
